    "3. `regrade` -- Anything related to HW/Lab/Exam regrades\n",
    "4. `hw` -- Anything related to homework (e.g. submissions)\n",
    "5. `enrollment` -- Anything related to Calcentral/course enrollment issues\n",

    "Email 1: \"okay thanks, i will email you closer to the exam date. as a heads up you will be escorted by a ta from your 294 class to the dsp exam room (it will be in the dsp exam room because of this special circumstance) i.e. you won't have time to go home/take a break if you are accepting this accommodation. please confirm  best\"\n",

    "The first email should be classified as 7 ('DSP') because from just its content alone, that would be our best guess. If we read the earlier thread, we'd know it has to do with Midterm Conflicts, but try not to let that bias your classification to best help our model. Likewise, the second email should be 1 ('miscl') even though we know from the threat the context."
