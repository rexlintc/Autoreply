    "The first email should be classified as 7 ('DSP') because from just its content alone, that would be our best guess. If we read the earlier thread, we'd know it has to do with Midterm Conflicts, but try not to let that bias your classification to best help our model. Likewise, the second email should be 1 ('miscl') even though we know from the threat the context."
